When you connect to the unc campus network, sometimes you will be automatically connected to UNC-setup. And if in connecting with that network, you attempt to open your closed browser with some previous-opened tabs, the brower will try to restore those tabs and UNC-Setup will redirect the URL to a set up URL.

This tool is for you to get the original URL. In cmd, type python main.py, and paste the redirected URL. You will get the old URL.
